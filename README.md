# grid system 
Most bootstrap classes are unused in small projects, and using the bootstrap framework only increases the size of the project.
Also, Bootstrap's customization elements are too weak to develop personal styles.
Just by adding these styles to the project, we can use the standards of the Bootstrap grid system without installing Bootstrap.
Into the "custom" file, are included Bootstrap's basic styles, like 'margin-0' or 'display-flex' which are often used and useful.
